## Use

In order to use this application, simply navigate to the website link provided and start navigating through the site! There are four major sections of the application. The first one is the homepage that will give you various states related to crypto, including how many there currently are, the number of exchanges, total market cap, etc. You will also find the stats of the top 10 crytpos which includes their current price, market cap, and percent change over the last 24 hours. Even further down the homepage will be the top six news articles related to crytpo within the last 24 hours.

The second section of the site is the detailed cryptocurrencies section. You can navigate to this part of the site by clicking 'cryptocurrencies' on the navbar. Here you'll find the top 100 cryptocurrencies with their respective stats just like in the homepage. You can even filter the list by typing what crypto you want to search in the searchbar.

On the Exhanges section, you'll get a detailed overview of the top exchanges. This includes the 24 hour trading volume, the number of markets available on the exchange, and the change in trading volume. If you click on the exchange row, you'll find a more detailed overview of the exchange, including their history and what they offer. Not all exchanges have a detailed overview, however.

Lastly, there is the News section. More news articles are featured in this section related to crypto. Like the 'crytpocurrencies' section, you can filter the news articles by selecting a specific cryptocurrency.
